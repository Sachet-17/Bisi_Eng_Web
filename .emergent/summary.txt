<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a business website. The initial instruction was to create a pixel-perfect clone of .

Subsequently, the user's requirements evolved:
1.  Restructure the website into a multi-page application with the following pages: Home, About Us, Services, Project Portfolio, Meet Our Team, Licenses/Certifications, Clients, Gallery, and Testimonials. The 'About Us' page should have sub-sections for 'Message from the MD', 'Our Capabilities', 'Our Company Policy', 'Organizational Capabilities', and 'Organizational Structure'.
2.  Refactor the codebase to be well-structured, remove all placeholder images, and create a clear folder hierarchy for future image uploads ().
3.  Implement cool animations and transitions for page navigation, scrolling, and interactive elements.
4.  Replace the cloned content and branding with information from a provided PDF for a company named BISI ENGINEERING. This includes updating the text content, logo, and color scheme.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A multi-page React application has been built, based on the initial clone. It uses React Router for navigation and Framer Motion for animations. The page structure matches the user's request, and all content is sourced from a central  file. A  component has been implemented to gracefully handle missing images, and a dedicated folder structure under  is in place. The content and logo have been updated according to the BISI ENGINEERING PDF. The agent has started updating the color scheme from the original orange to the new branding's green, but this work is incomplete.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The agent was in the process of updating the website's color scheme from the original orange (from the Brentor template) to the new green and blue branding of BISI ENGINEERING. It successfully updated the  but has not yet propagated the new color theme to the rest of the application or the global CSS variables.
-   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** screenshot tool
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
*   This section is empty as there are no outstanding bugs or issues.

**In progress Task List**:
*   **Task 1: Complete the Color Scheme Update (P0)**
    *   **Where to resume:** The agent needs to update the global color definitions to match the BISI ENGINEERING branding (green/blue). This involves modifying CSS variables in  and the theme object in . After updating the global styles, the agent must review all page and component files to replace any remaining hardcoded orange color classes (e.g., , ) with the new primary/accent theme colors.
    *   **What will be achieved with this?** The website's visual identity will be consistent with the new BISI ENGINEERING branding across all pages.
    *   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    *   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
    *   **Blocked on something:** None

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
*   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    *   **Flesh out 'About Us' Page (P1):** The user requested several distinct sections for the About Us page. The current page is a simple placeholder. This task involves creating components for each sub-section ('Message from the MD', 'Our Capabilities', etc.) and integrating them into .
    *   **Populate with User Images (P1):** The site is ready to accept images. Once the user provides them, they need to be placed in the designated folders (e.g., , ) and the paths in  must be updated accordingly.

*   **Future Tasks:**
    *   **Backend Integration (P2):** The user has been prompted that the data is currently mocked. If they request dynamic functionality (e.g., a contact form, a content management system), a backend will need to be developed with a database and API endpoints to replace the mock data.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Brentor Template Clone:** Successfully cloned the initial frontend design of the requested website.
- **Multi-Page Restructuring:** Converted the single-page layout into a multi-page application using React Router. Created pages for Home, About, Services, Projects, Team, Certifications, Clients, Gallery, Testimonials, and Contact.
- **Codebase & Asset Refactoring:**
    - Established a clean image folder structure under .
    - Implemented a  component () to prevent broken UI from missing images.
- **Animation Implementation:**
    - Installed .
    - Implemented page transitions in  and added scroll-reveal and interactive animations across all pages using custom animation components.
- **Content & Branding Update:**
    - Extracted content from the user-provided BISI ENGINEERING Info.pdf.
    - Populated  with the new content.
    - Updated the Navbar and Footer to use the BISI Engineering logo.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
*   None.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
*   None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend:** React, React Router
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS
- **Animations:** Framer Motion
- **Data Management:** All content is mocked and managed in a single JavaScript file ().
- **Architecture:** Component-based architecture with a clear separation between pages, reusable components, and data.

**key DB schema**
*   N/A (No database has been implemented).

**changes in tech stack**
*    was added to the frontend dependencies.

**All files of reference**
-   : The central source for all website content. All text changes will be made here.
-   : Instructions on where to place new images.
-   : Contains the main routing logic and page transition animations.
-   : Main CSS file, contains CSS variables that need to be updated for the new theme.
-   : TailwindCSS configuration, also needs to be checked for color theme updates.
-   : Directory containing all individual page components that need a color-scheme review.
-   : Contains the reusable animation wrapper components.
-   : Custom component to render image placeholders if the actual image file is missing.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
*   None at this moment.

**key api endpoints**
*   N/A (No backend has been implemented).

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   The primary immediate task is to finish the rebranding from the Brentor orange theme to the BISI ENGINEERING green/blue theme. This is a visual task that is currently half-done. The best approach is to modify the global theme files (, ) and then perform a search-and-replace for any hardcoded orange color classes in the JSX files.
-   The entire application is frontend-only and relies on . No backend or database calls exist.
-   The user has approved the structure and animations. The next steps after the color theme update will likely involve adding the specific content and images they provide.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
*   None.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
